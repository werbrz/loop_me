case study - short code illustrating my ordinary task

A few days ago, Olha asked me to share with you a code sample that I am proud of.
Since I mainly code at work, I can't provide you with them, so I decided to prepare a small project to illustrate more or less how I approach my typical tasks.

Since I already know that you translate your codes from R to Python, I decided to code in R as it is a less popular language and I have also been working with R for last few months.


I used the Kaggle Walmart dataset
